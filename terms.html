    (“Terms of Service”, “Terms & Conditions”), including those additional terms
    and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink.
    These Terms of Service apply to all users of the site, including without

    <h2>ACCESS AND CHANGES</h2>

    Our website changes regularly and access to this site is permitted on a
    temporary basis. We aim to update our site regularly, and may change the
    content at any time, including the product details and pricing without
    notice. If the need arises, we may suspend access to our site, or close it

    given time, and we are under no obligation to update such material. You are
    also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access our site through
    your Internet connection are aware of these terms, and that they comply with
    them.

    <h2>CONTRACT</h2>

    No contract will exist between you and Natalie Perry Jewellery for the sale
    of any product unless and until Natalie Perry Jewellery has accepted your
    order with a confirmation email and a full payment is taken from your
    credit/ debit card or via Paypal. Our acceptance of your order brings into
    existence a legally binding contract between us. Only adults (persons aged
    18 and over) are entitled to enter into legally binding contracts. Natalie
    Perry Jewellery reserves the right not to accept your order in the event
    that we are unable to obtain authorisation for payment, if shipping
    restrictions apply to a particular item, if the item ordered does not meet
    our quality control standards and is withdrawn, out of stock or if there is
    an error in pricing or content. We may also refuse to process and therefore
    accept a transaction for any reason or refuse service to anyone at any time
    at our sole discretion. We will not be liable for any indirect or
    consequential loss, damage or expenses arising from not accepting your order
    and we shall have no liability to you, by way of compensation, other than to
    refund the amount paid for the goods in question.

    <h2>PAYMENT</h2>

    By purchasing on this site you confirm that the Paypal account or
    credit/debit card that is being used is yours or that you have been
    specifically authorised by the owner of the Paypal account or credit/debit
    card to use it. All credit/debit cardholders are subject to validation
    checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment
    card refuses to authorise payment we will not be liable for any delay or
    non-delivery. Payment can be made by Paypal or via your credit/debit card
    linked to your Paypal account. Also by any other methods that may be
    advertised on our website site. All credit/debit card transactions on this
    site are processed using Pay Pal, which is a secure online payment gateway
    which encrypts your card details in a secure host environment. The prices
    payable for ordered goods are as set out in our website in GBP (UK Pounds).
    All prices are inclusive of the UK VAT. Delivery charges will be clearly
    displayed when selected and included in the total cost.

    <h2>ORDER CANCELLATION</h2>

    Unless you cancel your order within 5 working days after full payment has
    been made, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract between

    <h2>DEFECTIVE AND DAMAGED ITEMS</h2>

    All parcels must immediately be opened in the presence of the Courier upon
    receipt of the goods, to verify that the Goods are contained in the parcel
    are untampered with and undamaged. You acknowledge that if you fail to do
    this and subsequently find the Goods are not contained therein, or have been
    damaged during delivery, we may not be able to claim against the Courier or
    against our insurers. Accordingly, if you do fail to do this, you agree that
    you will be solely liable for any such loss or damage and shall waive,
    release and indemnify us from and against any claims relating thereto, to
    the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If you should receive an
    item that is defective, damaged or not what you ordered, please contact us
    here within 5 working days. We will help you resolve any issues as quickly
    as possible by replacing the item, once the faulty item has been returned to
    us by post. We will confirm the return address in writing, once you have
    contacted us about the fault.

    <h2>REFUNDS AND EXCHANGES</h2>

    In the unlikely event that you are unhappy with your order please don’t
    hesitate to contact us here. Each piece of Natalie Perry jewellery is made
    to order, therefore we cannot offer a refund on a piece unless it is found
    to be faulty. In certain circumstances we may be able to offer an exchange
    for another piece. Read more about our refund policy here. Upon receipt of
    items, the Paypal account, credit or debit card originally used for the
    purchase will be credited with the cost of the goods minus the delivery
    charges (exceptions may apply). We will process your refund within 48 hours
    of receipt. Your credit card company may take 4-7 working days to credit
    your account.
